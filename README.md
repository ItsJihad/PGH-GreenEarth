## Whats the project about?


```bash
  Here they have given some API endpoints related to Trees.
  and my job was to create the front End exactly as the Figma Design they provided.
  But they didn't provide any Design for the Responsive Layout.so i had to Design & implement the Responsive Layout on my own.
  
```
```bash
  Then my job was to call those APIs & show the Datas on the CARDS section.
  and Category Buttons on the Category Sections.
  
```
```bash
  and i had to Designs some function that will let an user to click on a product and add it or remove it from the Cart section.
  
```
